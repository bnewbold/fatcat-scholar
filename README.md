`fatcat-scholar` / Internet Archive Scholar
===========================================

This is source code for an experimental ("alpha") full-text web search interface
over the 25+ million open research papers in the [fatcat](https://fatcat.wiki)
catalog. A demonstration (pre-production) interface is available at
<https://scholar-qa.archive.org>.

All of the heavy lifting of harvesting, crawling, and metadata corrections are
handled by the fatcat service; this service is just a bare-bones, read-only
search interface. Unlike the basic fatcat.wiki search, this index allows
querying the full content of papers when available.


## Overview

This repository is fairly small and contains:

- `fatcat_scholar/`: Python code for web serivce and indexing pipeline
- `fatcat_scholar/templates/`: HTML template for web interface
- `tests/`: Python test files
- `proposals/`: design documentation and change proposals
- `data/`: empty directory for indexing pipeline

A data pipeline converts groups of one or more fatcat "release" entities
(grouped under a single "work" entitiy) into a single search index document.
Elasticsearch is used as the full-text search engine. A simple web interface
parses search requests and formats Elasticsearch results with highlights and
first-page thumbnails.

The current Python web framework is FastAPI, though the number of routes is
very small and it would be easy to switch to a more conventional framework like
Flask.


## Getting Started for Developers

You need `pipenv` and Python 3.8 installed. Most tasks are run using a
Makefile; `make help` will show all options.

Working on the indexing pipeline effectively requires internal access to the
Internet Archive cluster and services, though some contributions and bugfixes
are probably possible without staff access.

To install dependencies for the first time run:

    `make dep`

then run the tests (to ensure everything is working):

    `make test`


While developing the web interface, you will almost certainly need an example
database running locally. A docker-compose file in `extra/docker/` can be used
to run Elasticsearch 7.x locally. The `make dev-index` command will reset the
local index with the correct schema mapping, and index any intermediate files
in the `./data/` directory. We don't have an out-of-the-box solution for non-IA
staff at this step (yet).

After making changes to any user interface strings, the interface translation file (".pot") needs to be updated with `make extract-i18n`. When these changes are merged to master, the Weblate translation system will be updated automatically.

This repository uses `black` for code formatting; please run `make fmt` and
`make lint` for submitting a pull request.
