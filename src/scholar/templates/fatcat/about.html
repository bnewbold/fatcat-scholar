<h1>Internet Archive Scholar Catalog</h1>

<p>TODO</p>

<p>Feedback and queries can be directed to
<strong><a href="mailto:scholar@archive.org">scholar@archive.org</a></strong>.</p>

<h3>Goals and Features</h3>

<p>A few things set this catalog apart from similar indexing and discovery services:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    inclusion of archival, <strong>file-level metadata (hashes)</strong> in
    addition to URLs, which allows automated verification ("do I have the right
    copy"), reveals content-drift over time, and enables efficient distribution
    of content through the ecosystem
  </li>
  <li>
    native support for "post-PDF" digital media, including <strong>archival web
      captures and datasets</strong>, as well as content stored on the
    distributed web
  </li>
  <li>
    data model that captures the <strong>work/edition distinction</strong>,
    grouping pre-print, post-review, published, re-published, and updated
    versions of a work together
  </li>
  <li>
    focus on providing a stable API and corpus (making integration with diverse
    user-facing applications simple), while enabling full replication and
    mirroring of the corpus to <strong>reduce the risks of centralized
    control</strong>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Sources of Metadata</h3>

<p>
The source of all bibliographic information is recorded in edit history
metadata, which allows the provenance of all records to be reconstructed. A few
major sources are worth highlighting here:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    Release metadata from <strong>Crossref</strong>, via their public
    <a href="https://github.com/CrossRef/rest-api-doc">REST API</a>
  </li>
  <li>
    Release metadata and linked full-text content from NIH <strong>Pubmed</strong> and <strong><a href="https://arxiv.org">arXiv.org</a></strong>
  </li>
  <li>
    Release metadata and linked public domain full-text content the <strong>JSTOR</strong> Early Journal Content collection
  </li>
  <li>
    Creator names and de-duplication from <strong>ORCID</strong>, via their annual public data releases
  </li>
  <li>
    Journal title metadata from <strong>DOAJ</strong>, <strong>ISSN ROAD</strong>, and <strong>SHERPA/RoMEO</strong>
  </li>
 <li>
   Full-text URL lists from <strong><a href="https://core.ac.uk">CORE</a></strong>,
 <strong><a href="http://unpaywall.org">Unpaywall</a></strong>,
 <strong><a href="https://www.semanticscholar.org">Semantic Scholar</a></strong>,
 <strong><a href="https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu">CiteseerX</a></strong>,
 and <strong><a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/project/academic">Microsoft Academic Graph</a></strong>.
 </li>
</ul>

<p>
Initial `file` metadata and matches (file-to-release) come from earlier
Internet Archive matching efforts, and in particular efforts to extra
bibliographic metadata from PDFs (using GROBID) and fuzzy match (with
conservative settings) to Crossref metadata.
</p>

<p>
Many thanks for the hard work of all these projects, institutions, and
individuals!

<h3>Bulk Exports</h3>

<p>The Scholar Catalog is periodically dumped for public consumption.</p>

<p>The internal database schema is not
stable, so not as useful for longitudinal analysis. These dumps will include
edits-in-progress, deleted entities, old revisions, etc, which are potentially
difficult or impossible to fetch through the API.</p>

<p>Public copies may have some tables redacted (eg, API credentials).</p>

<p>Dumps are in PostgreSQL `pg_dump` "tar" binary format, and can be restored
locally with the `pg_restore` command.</p>

<p>All exports and dumps get uploaded to the Internet Archive under the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/fatcat_snapshots_and_exports?&sort=-publicdate">Fatcat Database Snapshots and Bulk Metadata Exports</a> collection.

<h3>Support and Acknowledgments</h3>

<p>Scholar Catalog is a project of the <strong><a href="https://archive.org">Internet Archive</a></strong>,
a US-based non-profit digital library, well known for its
<a href="https://web.archive.org">Wayback Machine</a> web archive,
<a href="https://openlibrary.org">Open Library</a>, and book digitization and
lending services.</p>

<p>Development of Scholar Catalog and related web harvesting, indexing, and preservation
efforts at the Archive have been partially funded by
a generous grant from the <strong>Andrew W. Mellon Foundation</strong>
(<a href="https://blog.archive.org/2018/03/05/andrew-w-mellon-foundation-awards-grant-to-the-internet-archive-for-long-tail-journal-preservation/">"Long-tail Open Access Journal Preservation"</a>).
We support this work by both tracking which open access works are in known
archives and providing minimum-viable indexing and access mechanisms for
long-tail works which otherwise would lack them.</p>

<p>The service would not technically be possible without hundreds of Free
Software components and the efforts of their individual and organizational
maintainers, more than can be listed here (please see the source code for full
lists). A few major components include the PostgreSQL database, Elasticsearch
search engine, FastAPI python web framework, Rust programming language, Diesel
database library, Swagger/OpenAPI code generators, Kafka distributed log,
Ansible configuration management tool, and Ubuntu GNU/Linux operating system
distribution.</p>

source code repository (<code>CONTRIBUTORS.md</code>). Thanks everybody!</p>
