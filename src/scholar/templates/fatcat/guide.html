<h3 id="entity-types-and-ontology"><a class="header" href="#entity-types-and-ontology">Entity Types and Ontology</a></h3>

<p>Loosely following &quot;Functional Requirements for Bibliographic Records&quot; (FRBR),
but removing the &quot;manifestation&quot; abstraction, and favoring files (digital
artifacts) over physical items, the primary bibliographic entity types are:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>work</code>: representing an abstract unit of creative output. Does
    not contain any metadata itself; used only to group <code>release</code>
    entities. For example, a journal article could be posted as a pre-print,
    published on a journal website, translated into multiple languages, and then
    re-published (with minimal changes) as a book chapter; these would all be
    variants of the same <code>work</code>.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>release</code>: a specific &quot;release&quot; or &quot;publicly published&quot; version of a work.
    Contains traditional bibliographic metadata (title, date of publication,
    media type, language, etc). Has relationships to other entities:
    <ul>
      <li>child of a single <code>work</code> (required)</li>
      <li>multiple <code>creator</code> entities as &quot;contributors&quot; (authors, editors)</li>
      <li>outbound references to multiple other <code>release</code> entities</li>
      <li>member of a single <code>container</code>, for example a journal or book series</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>file</code>: a single concrete, fixed digital artifact; a manifestation of one or
    more <code>releases</code>. Machine-verifiable metadata includes file hashes, size, and
    detected file format. Verified URLs link to locations on the open web where
    this file can be found or has been archived. Has relationships:
    <ul>
      <li>multiple <code>release</code> entities that this file is a complete manifestation of (almost always a single release)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>fileset</code>: a list of muliple concrete files, together forming complete
    <code>release</code> manifestation. Primarily intended for datasets and supplementary
    materials; could also contain a paper &quot;package&quot; (source file and figures).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>webcapture</code>: a single snapshot (point in time) of a webpage or small website
    (multiple pages) which are a complete manifestation of a <code>release</code>. Not a
    landing page or page referencing the release.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>creator</code>: persona (pseudonym, group, or specific human name) that
    has contributed to one or more <code>release</code>. Not necessarily one-to-one with a
    human person.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>container</code> (aka &quot;venue&quot;, &quot;serial&quot;, &quot;title&quot;): a grouping of releases from a
    single publisher.
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note that, compared to many similar bibliographic ontologies, the current one does not have entities to represent:</p>

<ul>
  <li>physical artifacts, either generically or specific copies</li>
  <li>funding sources</li>
  <li>publishing entities</li>
  <li>&quot;events at a time and place&quot;</li>
</ul>

<p>Each entity type has its own relations and fields (captured in a schema), but
there are are also generic operations and fields common across all entities.
The API for creating, updating, querying, and inspecting entities is roughly
the same regardless of type.</p>

<h3 id="common-entity-fields"><a class="header" href="#common-entity-fields">Common Entity Fields</a></h3>

<p>All entities have:</p>

<ul>
  <li><code>extra</code> (dict, optional): free-form JSON metadata</li>
</ul>

<p>The &quot;extra&quot; field is an &quot;escape hatch&quot; to include extra fields not in the
regular schema. It is intended to enable gradual evolution of the schema, as
well as accommodating niche or field-specific content. Reasonable care should
be taken with this extra metadata: don't include large text or binary fields,
hundreds of fields, duplicate metadata, etc.</p>

<p>All full entities (distinct from revisions) also have the following fields:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <code>state</code> (string, read-only): summarizes the status of the entity in the
    catalog. One of a small number of fixed values, see vocabulary below.
  </li>
  <li><code>ident</code> (string, Fatcat identifier, read-only): the Fatcat entity identifier</li>
  <li>
    <code>revision</code> (string, UUID): the current revision record that this entity
    <code>ident</code> points to
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>redirect</code> (string, Fatcat identifier, optional): if set, this entity ident
    has been redirected to the <code>redirect</code> one. This is a mechanism of merging or
    &quot;deduplicating&quot; entities.
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>edit_extra</code> (dict, optional): not part of the bibliographic schema, but can
    be included when creating or updating entities using the API, and the
    contents of field will be included in the entity's edit history.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="state-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#state-vocabulary"><code>state</code> Vocabulary</a></h3>

<ul>
  <li><code>active</code>: entity exists in the catalog</li>
  <li><code>redirect</code>: the entity <code>ident</code> exists in the catalog, but is a redirect to another entity ident.</li>
  <li>
    <code>deleted</code>: an entity with the <code>ident</code> did exist in the catalog previously,
    but it was deleted. The <code>ident</code> is retained as a &quot;tombstone&quot; record (aka,
    there is a record that an entity <em>did</em> exist previously).
  </li>
  <li>
    <code>wip</code> (&quot;Work in Progress&quot;): an entity identifier has been created as part of
    an editgroup, but that editgroup has not been accepted yet into the catalog,
    and there is no previous/current version of the entity.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="identifiers-and-revisions"><a class="header" href="#identifiers-and-revisions">Identifiers and Revisions</a></h3>

<p>A specific version of any entity in the catalog is called a &quot;revision&quot;.
Revisions are generally immutable (do not change and are not editable), and are
not normally referred to directly. Instead, persistent &quot;fatcat identifiers&quot;
(<code>ident</code>) can be created, which &quot;point to&quot; a single revision at a time. This
distinction means that entities referred to by an identifier can change over
time (as metadata is corrected and expanded). Revision objects do not &quot;point&quot;
back to specific identifiers, so they are not the same as a simple &quot;version
number&quot; for an identifier.</p>

<p>Identifiers also have the ability to be merged (by redirecting one identifier
to another) and &quot;deleted&quot; (by pointing the identifier to no revision at all).
All changes to identifiers are captured as an &quot;edit&quot; object. Edit history can
be fetched and inspected on a per-identifier basis.</p>

<h3 id="controlled-vocabularies"><a class="header" href="#controlled-vocabularies">Controlled Vocabularies</a></h3>

<p>Some individual fields have additional constraints, either in the form of
pattern validation (&quot;values must be upper case, contain only certain
characters&quot;), or membership in a fixed set of values. These may include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>license and open access status</li>
  <li>work &quot;types&quot; (article vs. book chapter vs. proceeding, etc)</li>
  <li>contributor types (author, translator, illustrator, etc)</li>
  <li>human languages</li>
  <li>identifier namespaces (DOI, ISBN, ISSN, ORCID, etc; but not the identifiers themselves)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other fixed-set &quot;vocabularies&quot; become too large to easily maintain or express
in code. These could be added to the backend databases, or be enforced by bots
(instead of the system itself). These mostly include externally-registered
identifiers or types, such as:</p>

<ul>
  <li>file mimetypes</li>
  <li>identifiers themselves (DOI, ORCID, etc), by checking for registration against canonical APIs and databases</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="global-edit-changelog"><a class="header" href="#global-edit-changelog">Global Edit Changelog</a></h3>

<p>As part of the process of &quot;accepting&quot; an edit group, a row is written to an
immutable, append-only table (which internally is a SQL table) documenting each
identifier change. This changelog establishes a monotonically increasing
version number for the entire corpus, and should make interaction with other
systems easier (eg, search engines, replicated databases, alternative storage
backends, notification frameworks, etc.).</p>

<h2 id="container-entity-reference"><a class="header" href="#container-entity-reference">Container Entity Reference</a></h2>

<h3 id="fields"><a class="header" href="#fields">Fields</a></h3>

<ul>
<li><code>name</code> (string, required): The title of the publication, as used in
international indexing services. Eg, &quot;Journal of Important Results&quot;. Not
necessarily in the native language, but also not necessarily in English.
Alternative titles (and translations) can be stored in &quot;extra&quot; metadata (see
below)</li>
<li><code>container_type</code> (string): eg, journal vs. conference vs. book series.
Controlled vocabulary is described below.</li>
<li><code>publication_status</code> (string): whether actively publishing, never published
anything, or discontinued. Controlled vocabularity is described below.</li>

of Curious Students&quot;.</li>
<li><code>issnl</code> (string): an external identifier, with registration controlled by the
<a href="http://www.issn.org/">ISSN organization</a>. Registration is relatively
inexpensive and easy to obtain (depending on world region), so almost all
serial publications have one. The ISSN-L (&quot;linking ISSN&quot;) is one of either
the print (<code>issp</code>) or electronic (<code>issne</code>) identifiers for a serial
publication; not all publications have both types of ISSN, but many do, which
can cause confusion. The ISSN master list is not gratis/public, but the
ISSN-L mapping is.</li>
<li><code>issne</code> (string): Electronic ISSN (&quot;ISSN-E&quot;)</li>
<li><code>issnp</code> (string): Print ISSN (&quot;ISSN-P&quot;)</li>

in citations, following the [ISO 4][] standard. Eg, &quot;Journal of Polymer
Science Part A&quot; -&gt; &quot;J. Polym. Sci. A&quot;</li>
<li><code>acronym</code> (string): acronym of publication name. Usually all upper-case, but
sometimes a very terse, single-word truncated form of the name (eg, a pun).</li>
<li><code>coden</code> (string): an external identifier, the [CODEN code][]. 6 characters,
all upper-case.</li>

under (eg, 'application/pdf', 'text/html')</li>
<li><code>first_year</code> (integer): first year of publication</li>
<li><code>last_year</code> (integer): final year of publication (implies that container is no longer active)</li>
<li><code>languages</code> (array of strings): ISO codes; the first entry is considered the
&quot;primary&quot; language (if that makes sense)</li>
<li><code>country</code> (string): ISO abbreviation (two characters) for the country this
container is published in</li>

<p>For KBART and other &quot;coverage&quot; fields, we &quot;over-count&quot; on the assumption that
works with &quot;in-progress&quot; status will soon actually be preserved. Elements of
these arrays are either an integer (means that single year is preserved), or an

entire <code>issue</code>, <code>corrupt</code> file. See vocabulary below.</li>
<li><code>release_ids</code> (array of string identifiers): references to <code>release</code> entities
that this file represents a manifestation of. Note that a single file can
contain multiple release references (eg, a PDF containing a full issue with
many articles), and that a release will often have multiple files (differing
only by watermarks, or different digitizations of the same printed work, or
variant MIME/media types of the same published work).</li>
<li><code>extra</code> (object with string keys): additional metadata about this file
<ul>

</ul>
<h3 id="content_scope-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#content_scope-vocabulary"><code>content_scope</code> Vocabulary</a></h3>
<p>This same vocabulary is shared between file, fileset, and webcapture entities;
not all the fields make sense for each entity type.</p>
<ul>
<li>if not set, assume that the artifact entity is valid and represents a
complete copy of the release</li>
<li><code>issue</code>: artifact contains an entire issue of a serial publication (eg, issue
of a journal), representing several releases in full</li>
<li><code>abstract</code>: contains only an abstract (short description) of the release, not
the release itself (unless the <code>release_type</code> itself is <code>abstract</code>, in which
case it is the entire release)</li>

with a <code>component</code> release entity. For example, a single figure or table as
part of an article</li>
<li><code>poster</code>: digital copy of a poster, eg as displayed at conference poster sessions</li>
<li><code>sample</code>: a partial sample of the entire work. eg, just the first page of an

corrupt or invalid. distinct from <code>sample</code></li>
<li><code>corrupt</code>: broken, mangled, or corrupt file (at the binary level)</li>
<li><code>stub</code>: any other out-of-scope artifact situations, where the artifact
represents something which would not link to any possible in-scope release in
the catalog (except a <code>stub</code> release)</li>
<li><code>landing-page</code>: for webcapture, the landing page of a work, as opposed to the
work itself</li>
<li><code>spam</code>: content is spam. articles, webpages, or issues which include
incidental advertisements within them are not counted as <code>spam</code></li>

as keys.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="human-names"><a class="header" href="#human-names">Human Names</a></h3>
<p>Representing names of human beings in databases is a fraught subject. For some
background reading, see:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.kalzumeus.com/2010/06/17/falsehoods-programmers-believe-about-names/">Falsehoods Programmers Believe About Names</a> (blog post)</li>
<li><a href="https://www.w3.org/International/questions/qa-personal-names">Personal names around the world</a> (W3C informational)</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hubert_Blaine_Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff_Sr.">Hubert Blaine Wolfeschlegelsteinhausenbergerdorff Sr.</a> (Wikipedia article)</li>
</ul>
<p>Particular difficult issues in the context of a bibliographic database include:</p>
<ul>
<li>the non-universal concept of &quot;family&quot; vs.  &quot;given&quot; names and their
relationship to first and last names</li>
<li>the inclusion of honorary titles and other suffixes and prefixes to a name</li>
<li>the distinction between &quot;preferred&quot;, &quot;legal&quot;, and &quot;bibliographic&quot; names, or
other situations where a person may not wish to be known under the name they
are commonly referred</li>
<li>language and character set issues</li>
<li>different conventions for sorting and indexing names</li>
<li>the sprawling world of citation styles</li>
<li>name changes</li>
<li>pseudonyms, anonymous publications, and fake personas (perhaps representing a
group, like Bourbaki)</li>
</ul>
<p>The general guidance for Fatcat is to:</p>
<ul>
<li>not be a &quot;source of truth&quot; for representing a persona or human being; ORCID
and Wikidata are better suited to this task</li>
<li>represent author personas, not necessarily 1-to-1 with human beings</li>
<li>balance the concerns of readers with those of the author</li>
<li>enable basic interoperability with external databases, file formats, schemas,
and style guides</li>
<li>when possible, respect the wishes of individual authors</li>
</ul>
<p>The data model for the <code>creator</code> entity has three name fields:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>surname</code> and <code>given_name</code>: needed for &quot;aligning&quot; with external databases,
and to export metadata to many standard formats</li>
<li><code>display_name</code>: the &quot;preferred&quot; representation for display of the entire name,
in the context of international attribution of authorship of a written work</li>
</ul>
<p>Names to not necessarily need to expressed in a Latin character set, but also
does not necessarily need to be in the native language of the creator or the
language of their notable works</p>
<p>Ideally all three fields are populated for all creators.</p>
<p>It seems likely that this schema and guidance will need review.</p>

<h3 id="fields"><a class="header" href="#fields">Fields</a></h3>
<p>Warning: This schema is not yet stable.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>cdx</code> (array of objects): each entry represents a distinct web resource
(URL). First is considered the primary/entry. Roughly aligns with CDXJ schema.
<ul>
<li><code>surt</code> (string, required): sortable URL format</li>
<li><code>timestamp</code> (string, datetime, required): ISO format, UTC timezone, with
<code>Z</code> prefix required, with second (or finer) precision. Eg,
&quot;2016-09-19T17:20:24Z&quot;. Wayback timestamps (like &quot;20160919172024&quot;) should
be converted naively.</li>
<li><code>url</code> (string, required): full URL</li>
<li><code>mimetype</code> (string): content type of the resource</li>
<li><code>status_code</code> (integer, signed): HTTP status code</li>
<li><code>sha1</code> (string, required): SHA-1 hash in lower-case hex</li>
<li><code>sha256</code> (string): SHA-256 hash in lower-case hex</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>archive_urls</code>: An array of &quot;typed&quot; URLs where this snapshot can be found.
Can be wayback/memento instances, or direct links to a WARC file containing
all the capture resources.  Often will only be a single archive. Order is not
meaningful, and may not be preserved.
<ul>
<li><code>url</code> (string, required):
Eg: &quot;https://example.edu/~frau/prcding.pdf&quot;.</li>
<li><code>rel</code> (string, required): Eg: &quot;wayback&quot; or &quot;warc&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>original_url</code> (string): base URL of the resource. May reference a specific
CDX entry, or maybe in normalized form.</li>
<li><code>timestamp</code> (string, datetime): same format as CDX line timestamp (UTC, etc).
Corresponds to the overall capture timestamp. Can be the earliest of CDX
timestamps if that makes sense</li>
<li><code>content_scope</code> (string): for situations where the webcapture does not simply
contain the full representation of a work (eg, HTML fulltext, for an
<code>article-journal</code> release), describes what that scope of coverage is. Eg,
<code>landing-page</code> it doesn't contain the full content. Landing pages are
out-of-scope for fatcat, but if they were accidentally imported, should mark
them as such so they aren't re-imported. Uses same vocabulary as File entity.</li>
<li><code>release_ids</code> (array of string identifiers): references to <code>release</code> entities</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="release-entity-reference"><a class="header" href="#release-entity-reference">Release Entity Reference</a></h2>
<h3 id="fields"><a class="header" href="#fields">Fields</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>title</code> (string, required): the display title of the release. May include subtitle.</li>
<li><code>subtitle</code> (string): intended only to be used primarily with books, not
journal articles. Subtitle may also be appended to the <code>title</code> instead of
populating this field.</li>
<li><code>original_title</code> (string): the full original language title, if <code>title</code> is translated</li>
<li><code>work_id</code> (fatcat identifier; required): the (single) work that this release
is grouped under. If not specified in a creation (<code>POST</code>) action, the API
will auto-generate a work.</li>
<li><code>container_id</code> (fatcat identifier): a (single) container that this release is
part of. When expanded the <code>container</code> field contains the full <code>container</code>
entity.</li>
<li><code>release_type</code> (string, controlled set): represents the medium or form-factor
of this release; eg, &quot;book&quot; versus &quot;journal article&quot;. Not necessarily
the same across all releases of a work. See definitions below.</li>
<li><code>release_stage</code> (string, controlled set): represents the publishing/review
lifecycle status of this particular release of the work. See definitions
below.</li>
<li><code>release_date</code> (string, ISO date format): when this release was first made
publicly available. Blank if only year is known.</li>
<li><code>release_year</code> (integer): year when this release was first made
publicly available; should match <code>release_date</code> if both are known.</li>
<li><code>withdrawn_status</code> (optional, string, controlled set):</li>
<li><code>withdrawn_date</code> (optional, string, ISO date format): when this release was withdrawn.
Blank if only year is known.</li>
<li><code>withdrawn_year</code> (optional, integer): year when this release was withdrawn; should
match <code>withdrawn_date</code> if both are known.</li>
<li><code>ext_ids</code> (key/value object of string-to-string mappings): external
identifiers. At least an empty <code>ext_ids</code> object is always required for
release entities, so individual identifiers can be accessed directly.</li>
<li><code>volume</code> (string): optionally, stores the specific volume of a serial
publication this release was published in.
type: string</li>
<li><code>issue</code> (string): optionally, stores the specific issue of a serial
publication this release was published in.</li>
<li><code>pages</code> (string): the pages (within a volume/issue of a publication) that
this release can be looked up under. This is a free-form string, and could
represent the first page, a range of pages, or even prefix pages (like
&quot;xii-xxx&quot;).</li>
<li><code>version</code> (string): optionally, describes distinguishes this release version
from others. Generally a number, software-style version, or other short/slug
string, not a freeform description. Book &quot;edition&quot; descriptions can also go
in an <code>edition</code> extra field. Often used in conjunction with external
identifiers. If you're not certain, don't use this field!</li>
<li><code>number</code> (string): an inherent identifier for this release (or work), often
part of the title. For example, standards numbers, technical memo numbers,
book series number, etc. Not a book <code>chapter</code> number however (which can be
stored in <code>extra</code>). Depending on field or series-specific norms, the number
may be stored here, in the title, or in both fields.</li>
<li><code>publisher</code> (string): name of the publishing entity. This does not need to be
populated if the associated <code>container</code> entity has the publisher field set,
though it is acceptable to duplicate, as the publishing entity of a container
may differ over time. Should be set for singleton releases, like books.</li>
<li><code>language</code> (string, slug): the primary language used in this particular release of
the work. Only a single language can be specified; additional languages can
be stored in &quot;extra&quot; metadata (TODO: which field?). This field should be a
valid RFC1766/ISO639 language code (two letters). AKA, a controlled
vocabulary, not a free-form name of the language.</li>
<li><code>license_slug</code> (string, slug): the license of this release. Usually a
creative commons short code (eg, <code>CC-BY</code>), though a small number of other
short names for publisher-specific licenses are included (TODO: list these).</li>
<li><code>contribs</code> (array of objects): an array of authorship and other <code>creator</code> contributions to this
release. Contribution fields include:
<ul>
<li><code>index</code> (integer, optional): the (zero-indexed) order of this
author. Authorship order has significance in many fields. Non-author
contributions (illustration, translation, editorship) may or may not be
ordered, depending on context, but index numbers should be unique per
release (aka, there should not be &quot;first author&quot; and &quot;first translator&quot;)</li>
<li><code>creator_id</code> (identifier): if known, a reference to a specific <code>creator</code></li>
<li><code>raw_name</code> (string): the name of the contributor, as attributed in the
text of this work. If the <code>creator_id</code> is linked, this may be different
from the <code>display_name</code>; if a creator is not linked, this field is
particularly important. Syntax and name order is not specified, but most
often will be &quot;display order&quot;, not index/alphabetical (in Western
tradition, surname followed by given name).</li>
<li><code>role</code> (string, of a set): the type of contribution, from a controlled
vocabulary. TODO: vocabulary needs review.</li>
<li><code>extra</code> (string): additional context can go here. For example, author
affiliation, &quot;this is the corresponding author&quot;, etc.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>refs</code> (array of ident strings): references (aka, citations) to other releases. References
can only be linked to a specific target release (not a work), though it may
be ambiguous which release of a work is being referenced if the citation is
not specific enough. IMPORTANT: release refs are distinct from the <a href="#reference-graph-refcat">reference graph</a> API. Reference fields include:
<ul>
<li><code>index</code> (integer, optional): reference lists and bibliographies almost
always have an implicit order. Zero-indexed. Note that this is distinct
from the <code>key</code> field.</li>
<li><code>target_release_id</code> (fatcat identifier): if known, and the release
exists, a cross-reference to the Fatcat entity</li>
<li><code>extra</code> (JSON, optional): additional citation format metadata can be
stored here, particularly if the citation schema does not align. Common
fields might be &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;authors&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;, &quot;publisher&quot;, &quot;url&quot;, and
external identifiers (&quot;doi&quot;, &quot;isbn13&quot;).</li>
<li><code>key</code> (string): works often reference works with a short slug or index
number, which can be captured here. For example, &quot;[BROWN2017]&quot;. Keys
generally supersede the <code>index</code> field, though both can/should be
supplied.</li>
<li><code>year</code> (integer): year of publication of the cited release.</li>
<li><code>container_title</code> (string): if applicable, the name of the container of
the release being cited, as written in the citation (usually an
abbreviation).</li>
<li><code>title</code> (string): the title of the work/release being cited, as written.</li>
<li><code>locator</code> (string): a more specific reference into the work/release being
cited, for example the page number(s). For web reference, store the URL
in &quot;extra&quot;, not here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>abstracts</code> (array of objects): see below
<ul>
<li><code>sha1</code> (string, hex, required): reference to the abstract content (string).
Example: &quot;3f242a192acc258bdfdb151943419437f440c313&quot;</li>
<li><code>content</code> (string): The abstract raw content itself. Example: <code>&lt;jats:p&gt;Some abstract thing goes here&lt;/jats:p&gt;</code></li>
<li><code>mimetype</code> (string): not formally required, but should effectively always get
set. <code>text/plain</code> if the abstract doesn't have a structured format</li>
<li><code>lang</code> (string, controlled set): the human language this abstract is in. See
the <code>lang</code> field of release for format and vocabulary.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="external-identifiers-ext_ids"><a class="header" href="#external-identifiers-ext_ids">External Identifiers (<code>ext_ids</code>)</a></h3>
<p>The <code>ext_ids</code> object name-spaces external identifiers and makes it easier to
add new identifiers to the schema in the future.</p>
<p>Many identifier fields must match an internal regex (string syntax constraint)
to ensure they are properly formatted, though these checks aren't always
complete or correct in more obscure cases.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>doi</code> (string): full DOI number, lower-case. Example: &quot;10.1234/abcde.789&quot;.
See section below for more about DOIs specifically</li>
<li><code>wikidata_qid</code> (string): external identifier for Wikidata entities. These are
integers prefixed with &quot;Q&quot;, like &quot;Q4321&quot;. Each <code>release</code> entity can be
associated with at most one Wikidata entity (this field is not an array), and
Wikidata entities should be associated with at most a single <code>release</code>. In
the future it may be possible to associate Wikidata entities with <code>work</code>
entities instead.</li>
<li><code>isbn13</code> (string): external identifier for books. ISBN-9 and other formats
should be converted to canonical ISBN-13.</li>
<li><code>pmid</code> (string): external identifier for the PubMed database. These are bare
integers, but stored in a string format.</li>
<li><code>pmcid</code> (string): external identifier for PubMed Central database. These are
integers prefixed with &quot;PMC&quot; (upper case), like &quot;PMC4321&quot;. Versioned PMCIDs
can also be stored (eg, &quot;PMC4321.1&quot;; future clarification of whether versions
should <em>always</em> be stored will be needed.</li>
<li><code>core</code> (string): external identifier for the <a href="https://core.ac.uk/">CORE</a> open access
aggregator. Not used much in practice. These identifiers are integers, but
stored in string format.</li>
<li><code>arxiv</code> (string): external identifier to a (version-specific) <a href="https://arxiv.org">arxiv.org</a>
work. For releases, must always include the <code>vN</code> suffix (eg, <code>v3</code>).</li>
<li><code>jstor</code> (string): external identifier for works in JSTOR which do not have a
valid registered DOI.</li>
<li><code>ark</code> (string): ARK identifier.</li>
<li><code>mag</code> (DEPRECATED; string): Microsoft Academic Graph (MAG) identifier. As of
December 2021, no entities in the catalog have a value for this field.</li>
<li><code>doaj</code> (string): <a href="https://doaj.org">DOAJ</a> article-level identifier</li>
<li><code>dblp</code> (string): <a href="https://dblp.org">dblp</a> article-level identifier</li>
<li><code>oai</code> (string): OAI-PMH record id. Only use if no other identifier is available</li>
<li><code>hdl</code> (string): <a href="https://handle.net">handle.net</a> identifier. While DOIs are
technically handles, do not put DOIs in this field. Handles are normalized
to lower-case in the catalog (server-side).</li>

<li><code>container_name</code> (string) if not matched to a container entity</li>
<li><code>group-title</code> (string) for releases within an collection/group</li>
<li><code>translation_of</code> (release identifier) if this release is a translation of
another (usually under the same work)</li>
<li><code>superceded</code> (boolean) if there is another release under the same work that
should be referenced/indicated instead. Intended as a temporary hint until
proper work-based search is implemented. As an example use, all arxiv release
versions except for the most recent get this set.</li>
<li><code>is_work_alias</code> (boolean): if true, then this release is an alias or pointer to
the entire work, or the most recent version of the work. For example, some
data repositories have separate DOIs for each version of the dataset, then an
additional DOI that points to the &quot;latest&quot; version/DOI.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="release_type-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#release_type-vocabulary"><code>release_type</code> Vocabulary</a></h3>
<p>This vocabulary is based on the
<a href="http://docs.citationstyles.org/en/stable/specification.html#appendix-iii-types">CSL types</a>,
with a small number of (proposed) extensions:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>article-magazine</code></li>
<li><code>article-journal</code>, including pre-prints and working papers</li>
<li><code>book</code></li>
<li><code>chapter</code> is allowed as they are frequently referenced and read independent
of the entire book. The data model does not currently support linking a
subset of a release to an entity representing the entire release. The
release/work/file distinctions should not be used to group multiple chapters under
a single work; a book chapter can be its own work. A paper which is
republished as a chapter (eg, in a collection, or &quot;edited&quot; book) can have
both releases under one work. The criteria of whether to &quot;split&quot; a book and
have release entities for each chapter is whether the chapter has been
cited/reference as such.</li>
<li><code>dataset</code></li>
<li><code>entry</code>, which can be used for generic web resources like question/answer
site entries.</li>
<li><code>entry-encyclopedia</code></li>
<li><code>manuscript</code></li>
<li><code>paper-conference</code></li>
<li><code>patent</code></li>
<li><code>post-weblog</code> for blog entries</li>
<li><code>report</code></li>
<li><code>review</code>, for things like book reviews, not the &quot;literature review&quot; form of
<code>article-journal</code>, nor peer reviews (see <code>peer_review</code>). Note <code>review-book</code>
for book reviews specifically.</li>
<li><code>speech</code> can be used for eg, slides and recorded conference presentations
themselves, as distinct from <code>paper-conference</code></li>
<li><code>thesis</code></li>
<li><code>webpage</code></li>
<li><code>peer_review</code> (fatcat extension)</li>
<li><code>software</code> (fatcat extension)</li>
<li><code>standard</code> (fatcat extension), for technical standards like RFCs</li>
<li><code>abstract</code> (fatcat extension), for releases that are only an abstract of a
larger work. In particular, translations. Many are granted DOIs.</li>
<li><code>editorial</code> (custom extension) for columns, &quot;in this issue&quot;, and other
content published along peer-reviewed content in journals. Many are granted DOIs.</li>
<li><code>letter</code> for &quot;letters to the editor&quot;, &quot;authors respond&quot;, and
sub-article-length published content. Many are granted DOIs.</li>
<li><code>stub</code> (fatcat extension) for releases which have notable external
identifiers, and thus are included &quot;for completeness&quot;, but don't seem to
represent a &quot;full work&quot;.</li>
<li><code>component</code> (fatcat extension) for sub-components of a full paper or other
work. Eg, tables, or individual files as part of a dataset.</li>
</ul>
<p>An example of a <code>stub</code> might be a paper that gets an extra DOI by accident; the
primary DOI should be a full release, and the accidental DOI can be a <code>stub</code>
release under the same work. <code>stub</code> releases shouldn't be considered full
releases when counting or aggregating (though if technically difficult this may
not always be implemented). Other things that can be categorized as stubs
(which seem to often end up mis-categorized as full articles in bibliographic
databases):</p>
<ul>
<li>commercial advertisements</li>
<li>&quot;trap&quot; or &quot;honey pot&quot; works, which are fakes included in databases to
detect re-publishing without attribution</li>
<li>&quot;This page is intentionally blank&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;About the author&quot;, &quot;About the editors&quot;, &quot;About the cover&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Acknowledgments&quot;</li>
<li>&quot;Notices&quot;</li>
</ul>
<p>All other CSL types are also allowed, though they are mostly out of scope:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>article</code> (generic; should usually be some other type)</li>
<li><code>article-newspaper</code></li>
<li><code>bill</code></li>
<li><code>broadcast</code></li>
<li><code>entry-dictionary</code></li>
<li><code>figure</code></li>
<li><code>graphic</code></li>
<li><code>interview</code></li>
<li><code>legislation</code></li>
<li><code>legal_case</code></li>
<li><code>map</code></li>
<li><code>motion_picture</code></li>
<li><code>musical_score</code></li>
<li><code>pamphlet</code></li>
<li><code>personal_communication</code></li>
<li><code>post</code></li>
<li><code>review-book</code></li>
<li><code>song</code></li>
<li><code>treaty</code></li>
</ul>
<p>For the purpose of statistics, the following release types are considered
&quot;papers&quot;:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>article</code></li>
<li><code>article-journal</code></li>
<li><code>chapter</code></li>
<li><code>paper-conference</code></li>
<li><code>thesis</code></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="release_stage-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#release_stage-vocabulary"><code>release_stage</code> Vocabulary</a></h3>
<p>These roughly follow the <a href="http://web.archive.org/web/20091109125137/http://www2.lse.ac.uk/library/versions/VERSIONS_Toolkit_v1_final.pdf">DRIVER</a> publication version guidelines, with the addition of a <code>retracted</code> status.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>draft</code> is an early version of a work which is not considered for peer
review. Sometimes these are posted to websites or repositories for early
comments and feedback.</li>
<li><code>submitted</code> is the version that was submitted for publication. Also known as
&quot;pre-print&quot;, &quot;pre-review&quot;, &quot;under review&quot;. Note that this doesn't imply that
the work was every actually submitted, reviewed, or accepted for publication,
just that this is the version that &quot;would be&quot;. Most versions in pre-print
repositories are likely to have this status.</li>
<li><code>accepted</code> is a version that has undergone peer review and accepted for
published, but has not gone through any publisher copy editing or
re-formatting. Also known as &quot;post-print&quot;, &quot;author's manuscript&quot;,
&quot;publisher's proof&quot;.</li>
<li><code>published</code> is the version that the publisher distributes. May include minor
(gramatical, typographical, broken link, aesthetic) corrections. Also known
as &quot;version of record&quot;, &quot;final publication version&quot;, &quot;archival copy&quot;.</li>
<li><code>updated</code>: post-publication significant updates (considered a separate release
in Fatcat). Also known as &quot;correction&quot; (in the context of either a published
&quot;correction notice&quot;, or the full new version)</li>
<li><code>retraction</code> for post-publication retraction notices (should be a release
under the same work as the <code>published</code> release)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that in the case of a retraction, the original publication does not get
state <code>retracted</code>, only the retraction notice does. The original publication
does get a <code>withdrawn_status</code> metadata field set.</p>
<p>When blank, indicates status isn't known, and wasn't inferred at creation time.
Can often be interpreted as <code>published</code>, but be careful!</p>
<h3 id="withdrawn_status-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#withdrawn_status-vocabulary"><code>withdrawn_status</code> Vocabulary</a></h3>
<p>Don't know of an existing controlled vocabulary for things like retractions or
other reasons for marking papers as removed from publication, so invented my
own. These labels should be considered experimental and subject to change.</p>
<p>Note that some of these will apply more to pre-print servers or publishing
accidents, and don't necessarily make sense as a formal change of status for a
print journal publication.</p>
<p>Any value at all indicates that the release should be considered &quot;no longer
published by the publisher or primary host&quot;, which could mean different things
in different contexts. As some concrete examples, works are often accidentally
generated a duplicate DOI; physics papers have been taken down in response to
government order under national security justifications; papers have been
withdrawn for public health reasons (above and beyond any academic-style
retraction); entire journals may be found to be predatory and pulled from
circulation; individual papers may be retracted by authors if a serious mistake
or error is found; an author's entire publication history may be retracted in
cases of serious academic misconduct or fraud.</p>
<ul>
<li><code>withdrawn</code> is generic: the work is no longer available from the original
publisher. There may be no reason, or the reason may not be known yet.</li>
<li><code>retracted</code> for when a work is formally retracted, usually accompanied by a
retraction notice (a separate release under the same work). Note that the
retraction itself should not have a <code>withdrawn_status</code>.</li>
<li><code>concern</code> for when publishers release an &quot;expression of concern&quot;, often
indicating that the work is not reliable in some way, but not yet formally
retracted. In this case the original work is probably still available, but
should be marked as suspect. This is not the same as presence of errata.</li>
<li><code>safety</code> for works pulled for public health or human safety concerns.</li>
<li><code>national-security</code> for works pulled over national security concerns.</li>
<li><code>spam</code> for content that is considered spam (eg, bogus pre-print or repository
submissions). Not to be confused with advertisements or product reviews in
journals.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="contribsrole-vocabulary"><a class="header" href="#contribsrole-vocabulary"><code>contribs.role</code> Vocabulary</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><code>author</code></li>
<li><code>translator</code></li>
<li><code>illustrator</code></li>

<li><code>recipient</code></li>
<li><code>reviewed-author</code></li>

<p>If blank, indicates that type of contribution is not known; this can often be
interpreted as authorship.</p>

<h3 id="more-about-dois"><a class="header" href="#more-about-dois">More About DOIs</a></h3>
<p>All DOIs stored in an entity column should be registered (aka, should be
resolvable from <code>doi.org</code>). Invalid identifiers may be cleaned up or removed by
bots.</p>
<p>DOIs should <em>always</em> be stored and transferred in lower-case form. Note that
there are almost no other constraints on DOIs (and handles in general): they
may have multiple forward slashes, whitespace, of arbitrary length, etc.
Crossref has a <a href="https://www.crossref.org/blog/dois-unambiguously-and-persistently-identify-published-trustworthy-citable-online-scholarly-literature-right/">number of examples</a> of such &quot;valid&quot; but frustratingly
formatted strings.</p>
<p>In the Fatcat ontology, DOIs and release entities are one-to-one.</p>
<p>It is the intention to automatically (via bot) create a Fatcat release for
every Crossref-registered DOI from an allowlist of media types
(&quot;journal-article&quot; etc, but not all), and it would be desirable to auto-create
entities for in-scope publications from all registrars. It is not the intention
to auto-create a release for every registered DOI. In particular,
&quot;sub-component&quot; DOIs (eg, for an individual figure or table from a publication)
aren't currently auto-created, but could be stored in &quot;extra&quot; metadata, or on a
case-by-case basis.</p>

<p>A declarative specification of all API endpoints, JSON data models, and
response types is available in OpenAPI 2.0 format. Code generation tools are
used to generate both server-side type-safe endpoint routes and client-side
libraries. Auto-generated reference documentation is, for now, available at
<a href="https://api.fatcat.wiki">https://api.fatcat.wiki</a>.</p>
<p>All API traffic is over HTTPS; there is no HTTP endpoint, even for read-only
operations. All endpoints accept and return only JSON serialized content.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="bulk-exports"><a class="header" href="#bulk-exports">Bulk Exports</a></h2>
<p>There are several types of bulk exports and database dumps folks might be
interested in:</p>
<ul>
<li>complete database dumps</li>
<li>changelog history with all entity revisions and edit metadata</li>
<li>identifier snapshot tables</li>
<li>entity exports</li>
</ul>
<p>All exports and dumps get uploaded to the Internet Archive under the
<a href="https://archive.org/details/fatcat_snapshots_and_exports?&amp;sort=-publicdate">&quot;Fatcat Database Snapshots and Bulk Metadata Exports&quot;</a>
collection.</p>
<h3 id="complete-database-dumps"><a class="header" href="#complete-database-dumps">Complete Database Dumps</a></h3>
<p>The most simple and complete bulk export. Useful for disaster recovery,
mirroring, or forking the entire service. The internal database schema is not
stable, so not as useful for longitudinal analysis. These dumps will include
edits-in-progress, deleted entities, old revisions, etc, which are potentially
difficult or impossible to fetch through the API.</p>
<p>Public copies may have some tables redacted (eg, API credentials).</p>
<p>Dumps are in PostgreSQL <code>pg_dump</code> &quot;tar&quot; binary format, and can be restored
locally with the <code>pg_restore</code> command. See <code>./extra/sql_dumps/</code> for commands
and details. Dumps are on the order of 100 GBytes (compressed) and will grow
over time.</p>
<h3 id="changelog-history"><a class="header" href="#changelog-history">Changelog History</a></h3>
<p>These are currently unimplemented; would involve &quot;hydrating&quot; sub-entities into
changelog exports. Useful for some mirrors, and analysis that needs to track
provenance information. Format would be the public API schema (JSON).</p>
<p>All information in these dumps should be possible to fetch via the public API,
including on a feed/streaming basis using the sequential changelog index. All
information is also contained in the database dumps.</p>
<h3 id="identifier-snapshots"><a class="header" href="#identifier-snapshots">Identifier Snapshots</a></h3>
<p>Many of the other dump formats are very large. To save time and bandwidth, a
few simple snapshot tables can be exported directly in TSV format. Because
these tables can be dumped in single SQL transactions, they are consistent
point-in-time snapshots.</p>
<p>One format is per-entity identifier/revision tables. These contain active,
deleted, and redirected identifiers, with revision and redirect references, and
are used to generate the entity dumps below.</p>
<p>Other tables contain external identifier mappings or file hashes.</p>
<p>Release abstracts can be dumped in their own table (JSON format), allowing them
to be included only by reference from other dumps.  The copyright status and
usage restrictions on abstracts are different from other catalog content; see
the <a href="#metadata-licensing">metadata licensing</a> section for more context.  Abstracts are immutable and
referenced by hash in the database, so the consistency of these dumps is not as
much of a concern as with other exports.</p>
<p>Unlike all other dumps and public formats, the Fatcat identifiers in these
dumps are in raw UUID format (not base32-encoded), though this may be fixed in
the future.</p>
<p>See <code>./extra/sql_dumps/</code> for scripts and details. Dumps are on the order of a
couple GBytes each (compressed).</p>
<h3 id="entity-exports"><a class="header" href="#entity-exports">Entity Exports</a></h3>
<p>Using the above identifier snapshots, the Rust <code>fatcat-export</code> program outputs
single-entity-per-line JSON files with the same schema as the HTTP API. These
might contain the default fields, or be in &quot;expanded&quot; format containing
sub-entities for each record.</p>
<p>Only &quot;active&quot; entities are included (not deleted, work-in-progress, or
redirected entities).</p>
<p>These dumps can be quite large when expanded (over 100 GBytes compressed), but
do not include history so will not grow as fast as other exports over time. Not
all entity types are dumped at the moment; if you would like specific dumps get
in touch!</p>

<br>

<h2 id="fatcat-identifiers"><a class="header" href="#fatcat-identifiers">Fatcat Identifiers</a></h2>
<p>Fatcat identifiers are semantically meaningless fixed-length random numbers,
usually represented in case-insensitive base32 format. Each entity type has its
own identifier namespace.</p>
<p>128-bit (UUID size) identifiers encode as 26 characters (but note that not all
such strings decode to valid UUIDs), and in the backend can be serialized in
UUID columns:</p>
<pre><code>work_rzga5b9cd7efgh04iljk8f3jvz
https://fatcat.wiki/work/rzga5b9cd7efgh04iljk8f3jvz
</code></pre>
<p>In comparison, 96-bit identifiers would have 20 characters and look like:</p>
<pre><code>work_rzga5b9cd7efgh04iljk
https://fatcat.wiki/work/rzga5b9cd7efgh04iljk
</code></pre>
<p>and 64-bit:</p>
<pre><code>work_rzga5b9cd7efg
https://fatcat.wiki/work/rzga5b9cd7efg
</code></pre>
<p>Fatcat identifiers can used to interlink between databases, but are explicitly
<em>not</em> intended to supplant DOIs, ISBNs, handle, ARKs, and other &quot;registered&quot;
persistent identifiers for general use.</p>
<h3 id="internal-schema"><a class="header" href="#internal-schema">Internal Schema</a></h3>
<p>Internally, identifiers are lightweight pointers to &quot;revisions&quot; of an entity.
Revisions are stored in their complete form, not as a patch or difference; if
comparing to distributed version control systems (for managing changes to
source code), this follows the git model, not the mercurial model.</p>
<p>The entity revisions are immutable once accepted; the editing process involves
the creation of new entity revisions and, if the edit is approved, pointing the
identifier to the new revision. Entities cross-reference between themselves by
<em>identifier</em> not <em>revision number</em>. Identifier pointers also support
(versioned) deletion and redirects (for merging entities).</p>
<p>Edit objects represent a change to a single entity; edits get batched together
into edit groups (like &quot;commits&quot; and &quot;pull requests&quot; in git parlance).</p>
<p>SQL tables look something like this (with separate tables for entity type a la
<code>work_revision</code> and <code>work_edit</code>):</p>
<pre><code>entity_ident
    id (uuid)
    current_revision (entity_revision foreign key)
    redirect_id (optional; points to another entity_ident)
    is_live (boolean; whether newly created entity has been accepted)

entity_revision
    revision_id
    &lt;all entity-style-specific fields&gt;
    extra: json blob for schema evolution

entity_edit
    timestamp
    editgroup_id (editgroup foreign key)
    ident (entity_ident foreign key)
    new_revision (entity_revision foreign key)
    new_redirect (optional; points to entity_ident table)
    previous_revision (optional; points to entity_revision)
    extra: json blob for provenance metadata

editgroup
    editor_id (editor table foreign key)
    description
    extra: json blob for provenance metadata
</code></pre>
<p>An individual entity can be in the following &quot;states&quot;, from which the given
actions (transition) can be made:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>wip</code> (not live; not redirect; has rev)
<ul>
<li>activate (to <code>active</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>active</code> (live; not redirect; has rev)
<ul>
<li>redirect (to <code>redirect</code>)</li>
<li>delete (to <code>deleted</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>redirect</code> (live; redirect; rev or not)
<ul>
<li>split (to <code>active</code>)</li>
<li>delete (to <code>delete</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><code>deleted</code> (live; not redirect; no rev)
<ul>
<li>redirect (to <code>redirect</code>)</li>
<li>activate (to <code>active</code>)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>&quot;WIP, redirect&quot; or &quot;WIP, deleted&quot; are invalid states.</p>
<p>Additional entity-specific columns hold actual metadata. Additional
tables (which reference both <code>entity_revision</code> and <code>entity_id</code> foreign
keys as appropriate) represent things like authorship relationships
(creator/release), citations between works, etc. Every revision of an entity
requires duplicating all of these associated rows, which could end up
being a large source of inefficiency, but is necessary to represent the full
history of an object.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="sources"><a class="header" href="#sources">Sources</a></h2>
<p>The core metadata bootstrap sources, by entity type, are:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>releases</code>: Crossref metadata, with DOIs as the primary identifier, and
PubMed (central), Wikidata, and <a href="https://core.ac.uk">CORE</a> identifiers cross-referenced</li>
<li><code>containers</code>: munged metadata from the DOAJ, ROAD, and Norwegian journal
list, with ISSN-Ls as the primary identifier. ISSN provides an &quot;ISSN to
ISSN-L&quot; mapping to normalize electronic and print ISSN numbers.</li>
<li><code>creators</code>: ORCID metadata and identifier.</li>
</ul>
<p>Initial <code>file</code> metadata and matches (file-to-release) come from earlier
Internet Archive matching efforts, and in particular efforts to extra
bibliographic metadata from PDFs (using GROBID) and fuzzy match (with
conservative settings) to Crossref metadata.</p>
<p>The intent is to continuously ingest and merge metadata from a small number of
large (~2-3 million more more records) general-purpose aggregators and catalogs
in a centralized fashion, using bots, and then support volunteers and
organizations in writing bots to merge high-quality metadata from field or
institution-specific catalogs.</p>
<p>Progeny information (where the metadata comes from, or who &quot;makes specific
claims&quot;) is stored in edit metadata in the data model. Value-level attribution
can be achieved by looking at the full edit history for an entity as a series of
patches.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="reference-graph-refcat"><a class="header" href="#reference-graph-refcat">Reference Graph (refcat)</a></h2>
<p>In Summer 2021, the first version of a reference graph dataset, named &quot;refcat&quot;,
was released and integrated into the fatcat.wiki web interface. The dataset
contains billions of references between papers in the fatcat catalog, as well
as partial coverage of references from papers to books, to websites, and from
Wikipedia articles to papers. This is a first step towards identifying links
and references between scholarly works of all types preserved in archive.org.</p>
<p>The refcat dataset can be downloaded in JSON lines format from the archive.org
&quot;<a href="https://archive.org/details/fatcat_snapshots_and_exports">Fatcat Database Snapshots and Bulk Metadata Exports</a>&quot;
collection, and is released under a CC-0 license for broad reuse.
Acknowledgement and attribution for both the aggregated dataset and the
original metadata sources is strongly encouraged (see below for provenance
notes).</p>
<p>References can be browsed on fatcat.wiki on an &quot;outbound&quot; (&quot;References&quot;) and
&quot;inbound&quot; (&quot;Cited By&quot;) basis for individual release entities. There are also
special pages for Wikipedia articles (&quot;outbound&quot;, such as
<a href="https://fatcat.wiki/wikipedia/en:Internet/refs-out">Internet</a>) and Open
Library books (&quot;inbound&quot;, such as <a href="https://fatcat.wiki/openlibrary/OL2670078W/refs-in">The
Gift</a>). JSON versions of
these pages are available, but do not yet represent a stable API.</p>
<h3 id="how-it-works"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works">How It Works</a></h3>
<p>Raw reference data comes from multiple sources (see &quot;provenance&quot; below), but
has the common structure of a &quot;source&quot; entity (which could be a paper,
Wikipedia article, etc) and a list of raw references. There might be duplicate
references for a single &quot;source&quot; work coming from different providers (eg, both
Pubmed and Crossref reference lists). The goal is to match as many references
as possible to the &quot;target&quot; work being referenced, creating a link from source
to target. If a robust match is not found, the &quot;unmatched&quot; reference is
retained and displayed in a human readable fashion if possible.</p>
<p>Depending on the source, raw references may be a simple &quot;raw&quot; string in an
arbitrary citation style; may have been parsed or structured in fields like
&quot;title&quot;, &quot;year&quot;, &quot;volume&quot;, &quot;issue&quot;; might include a URL or identifier like an
arxiv.org identifier; or may have already been matched to a specific target
work by another party. It is also possible the reference is vague, malformed,
mis-parsed, or not even a reference to a specific work (eg, &quot;personal
communication&quot;). Based on the available structure, we might be able to do a
simple identifier lookup, or may need to parse a string, or do &quot;fuzzy&quot; matching
against various catalogs of known works. As a final step we take all original
and potential matches, verify the matches, and attempt to de-duplicate
references coming from different providers into a list of matched and unmatched
references as output. The refcat corpus is the output of this process.</p>
<p>Two dominant modes of reference matching are employed: identifier based
matching and fuzzy matching. Identifier based matching currently works with
DOI, Arxiv ids, PMID and PMCID and ISBN. Fuzzy matching employs a scalable way
to cluster documents (with pluggable clustering algorithms). For each cluster
of match candidates we run a more extensive verification process, which yields
a match confidence category, ranging from weak over strong to exact. Strong and
exact matches are included in the graph.</p>
<p>All the code for this process is available open source:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/refcat">refcat</a>: batch processing and matching pipeline, in Python and Go</li>
<li><a href="https://gitlab.com/internetarchive/fuzzycat">fuzzycat</a>: Python verification code and &quot;live&quot; fuzzy matching</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="metadata-provenance"><a class="header" href="#metadata-provenance">Metadata Provenance</a></h3>
<p>The provenance for each reference in the index is tracked and exposed via the
<code>match_provenance</code> field. A <code>fatcat-</code> prefix to the field means that the
reference came through the <code>refs</code> metadata field stored in the fatcat catalog,
but originally came from the indicated source. In the absence of <code>fatcat-</code>, the
reference was found, updated, or extracted at indexing time and is not recorded
in the <code>release</code> entity metadata.</p>
<p>Specific sources:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>crossref</code> (and <code>fatcat-crossref</code>): citations deposited by publishers as part
of DOI registration. Crossref is the largest single source of citation
metadata in refcat. These references may be linked to a specific DOI; contain
structured metadata fields; or be in the form of a raw citation string.
Sometimes they are &quot;complete&quot; for the given work, and sometimes they only
include references which could be matched/linked to a target work with a DOI.</li>
<li><code>fatcat-datacite</code>: same as <code>crossref</code>, but for the Datacite DOI registrar.</li>
<li><code>fatcat-pubmed</code>: references, linked or not linked, from Pubmed/MEDLINE
metadata</li>
<li><code>fatcat</code>: references in fatcat where the original provenance can't be inferred
(but could be manually found by inspecting the release edit history)</li>
<li><code>grobid</code>: references parsed out of full-text PDFs using
<a href="https://github.com/kermitt2/grobid">GROBID</a></li>
<li><code>wikipedia</code>: citations extracted from Wikipedia (see below for details)</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that sources of reference metadata which have formal licensing
restrictions, even CC-BY or ODC-BY licenses as used by several similar
datasets, are not included in refcat.</p>
<h3 id="current-limitations-and-known-issues"><a class="header" href="#current-limitations-and-known-issues">Current Limitations and Known Issues</a></h3>
<p>The initial Summer 2021 version of the index has a number of limitations.
Feedback on features and coverage are welcome! We expect this dataset to be
iterated over regularly as there are a few
dimensions along which the dataset can be improved and extended.</p>
<p>The reference matching process is designed to eventually operate in both
&quot;batch&quot; and &quot;live&quot; modes, but currently only &quot;batch&quot; output is in the index.
This means that references from newly published papers are not added to the
index in an ongoing fashion.</p>
<p>Fatcat &quot;release&quot; entities (eg, papers) are matched from a Spring 2021 snapshot.
References to papers published after this time will not be linked.</p>
<p>Wikipedia citations come from the dataset <a href="https://zenodo.org/record/3940692">Wikipedia Citations: A comprehensive
dataset of citations with identifiers extracted from English
Wikipedia</a>, by Singh, West, and Colavizza.
This is a one-time corpus based on a May 2020 snapshot of English Wikipedia
only, and is missing many current references and citations. Additionally, only
direct identifier lookups (eg, DOI matches) are used, not fuzzy metadata
matching.</p>
<p>Open Library &quot;target&quot; matches are based on a
<a href="https://openlibrary.org/developers/dumps">snapshot</a> of Open Library works, and
are matched either ISBN (extracted from citation string) or fuzzy metadata
matching.</p>
<p>Crossref references are extracted from a January 2021
<a href="https://archive.org/details/crossref_doi_dump_2021-01">snapshot</a> of Crossref
metadata, and do not include many updates to existing works.</p>
<p>Hundreds of millions of raw citation strings (&quot;unstructured&quot;) have not been
parsed into a structured for fuzzy matching. We plan to use GROBID to parse
these citation strings, in addition to the current use of GROBID parsing for
references from fulltext documents.</p>
<p>The current GROBID parsing used version v0.6.0. Newer versions of GROBID have
improved citation parsing accuracy, and we intend to re-parse all PDFs over
time. Additional manually-tagged training datasets could improve GROBID
performance even further.</p>
<p>In a future update, we intend to add Wayback (web archive) capture status and
access links for references to websites (distinct from references to online
journal articles or books). For example, references to an online news article
or blog post would indicate the closest (in time, to the &quot;source&quot; publication
date) Wayback captures to that web page, if available.</p>
<p>References are only displayed on fatcat.wiki, not yet on scholar.archive.org.</p>
<p>There is no current or planned mechanism for searching, sorting, or filtering
article search results by (inbound) citation count. This would require
resource-intensive transformations and continuous re-indexing of search
indexes.</p>
<p>It is unclear how the batch-generated refcat dataset and API-editable release
refs metadata will interact in the future. The original refs may eventually be
dropped from the fatcat API, or at some point the refcat corpus may stabilize
and be imported in to fatcat refs instead of being maintained as a separate
dataset and index. It would be good to retain a mechanism for human corrections
and overrides to the machine-generated reference graph.</p>

<br>
<h2 id="metadata-licensing"><a class="header" href="#metadata-licensing">Metadata Licensing</a></h2>
<p>The Fatcat catalog content license is the Creative Commons Zero (&quot;CC-0&quot;)
license, which is effectively a public domain grant. This applies to the
catalog metadata itself (titles, entity relationships, citation metadata, URLs,
hashes, identifiers), as well as &quot;meta-meta-data&quot; provided by editors (edit
descriptions, provenance metadata, etc).</p>
<p>The core catalog is designed to contain only factual information: &quot;this work,
known by this title and with these third-party identifiers, is believed to be
represented by these files and published under such-and-such venue&quot;. As a norm,
sourcing metadata (for attribution and provenance) is retained for each edit
made to the catalog.</p>
<p>A notable exception to this policy are abstracts, for which no copyright claims
or license is made. Abstract content is kept separate from core catalog
metadata; downstream users need to make their own decision regarding reuse and
distribution of this material.</p>
<p>As a social norm, it is expected (and appreciated!) that downstream users of
the public API and/or bulk exports provide attribution, and even transitive
attribution (acknowledging the original source of metadata contributed to
Fatcat). As an academic norm, researchers are encouraged to cite the corpus as
a dataset (when this option becomes available). However, neither of these norms
are enforced via the copyright mechanism.</p>
<br>
<h2 id="for-publishers"><a class="header" href="#for-publishers">For Publishers</a></h2>
<p>This page addresses common questions and concerns from publishers of research
works indexed in Fatcat, as well as the Internet Archive Scholar service built
on top of it.</p>
<p>For help in exceptional cases, contact Internet Archive through our usual
support channels.</p>
<h3 id="metadata-indexing"><a class="header" href="#metadata-indexing">Metadata Indexing</a></h3>
<p>Many publishers will find that metadata records are already included in fatcat
if they register persistent identifiers for their research works. This pipeline
is based on our automated harvesting of DOI, Pubmed, dblp, DOAJ, and other
metadata catalogs. This process can take some time (eg, days from
registration), does not (yet) cover all persistent identifiers, and will only
cover those works which get identifiers.</p>
<p>For publishers who find that they are not getting indexed in fatcat, our
primary advice is to register ISSNs for venues (journals, repositories,
conferences, etc), and to register DOIs for all current and back-catalog works.
DOIs are the most common and integrated identifier in the scholarly ecosystem,
and will result in automatic indexing in many other aggregators in addition to
fatcat/scholar. There may be funding or resources available for smaller
publishers to cover the cost of DOI registration, and ISSN registration is
usually no-cost or affordable through national institutions.</p>
<p>We <em>do not</em> recommend that journal or conference publishers use general-purpose
repositories like Zenodo to obtain no-cost DOIs for journal articles. These
platforms are a great place for pre-publication versions, datasets, software,
and other artifacts, but not for primary publication-version works (in our
opinion).</p>
<p>If DOI registration is not possible, one good alternative is to get included in
the Directory of Open Access Journals and deposit article metadata there. This
process may take some time, but is a good basic indicator of publication
quality. DOAJ article metadata is periodically harvested and indexed in fatcat,
after a de-duplication process.</p>
<h3 id="improving-automatic-preservation"><a class="header" href="#improving-automatic-preservation">Improving Automatic Preservation</a></h3>
<p>In alignment with its mission, Internet Archive makes basic automated attempts
to capture and preserve all open access research publications on the public
web, at no cost. This effort comes with no guarantees around completeness,
timeliness, or support communications.</p>
<p>Preservation coverage can be monitored through the journal-specific dashboards
or via the coverage search interface.</p>
<p>There are a few technical things publishers can do to increase their
preservation coverage, in addition to the metadata indexing tips above:</p>
<ul>
<li>use the <code>citation_pdf_url</code> HTML meta tag, when appropriate, to link directly
from article landing pages to PDF URLs</li>
<li>use simple HTML to represent landing pages and article content, and do not
require Javascript to render page content or links</li>
<li>ensure that hosting server <code>robots.txt</code> rules are not preventing or overly
restricting automated crawling</li>
<li>use simple, accessible PDF access links. Do not use time-limited or
IP-limited URLs, require specific referrer headers, or use cookies to
authenticate access to OA PDFs</li>
<li>minimize the number of HTTP redirects and HTML hops between DOI and fulltext
content</li>
<li>paywalls, loginwalls, geofencing, and anti-bot measures are all obviously
antithetical to open crawling and indexing</li>
</ul>
